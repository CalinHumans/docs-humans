# Humans Chain

**Humans** is a sovereign proof-of-stake blockchain, open-source platform, and will soon be the member of the IBC family of interconnected blockchains that comprise the Cosmos Ecosystem.

**Humans** is a next generation blockchain platform that brings together an ecosystem of stakeholders around the use of AI to create at scale. It combines a library of AI tools into a creative studio suite where users will be able to pick and choose as they bring their ideas to life. Individuals are empowered to create and own their digital likenesses, which may be used by themselves and others in the creation of any number of digital assets. The synthetic media, AI apps, and other digital assets utilize blockchain technology to generate Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a way of creating transparency, provenance, accountability, and long-term governance.  

## Humans Ecosystem


### Proof Of Human

**Proof of Human** is an integral component of the Humans.ai blockchain that acts as a governance, consensus and verification system, which helps ensure that behind every AI NFT there is a human decision.

### CosmWasm Integration

Humans will also act as a permission-less and censorship resistant platform for developers to deploy smart contracts in Go and Rust.

### Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)

Humans is IBC compliant at genesis and connected over 40 blockchains. IBC enables secure and permissionless transfers of funds between blockchains in addition to cross-chain computation and transfer of arbitrary data. This includes cross-chain smart contract calls, fee payments, NFTs, and fungible token transfers. IBC is not reliant on a multi-sig or centralized bridging solution.

The security of the Humans blockchain relies on a set of validators to commit new blocks and participate in Tendermint BFT consensus by brodcasting votes that contain cryptographic signatures signed by each validator's private key. Validators stake **HEART**, the protocol's native token used for gas, governance, and "mining". Users can delegate **HEART** to validators that record and verify transactions in exchange for rewards.
